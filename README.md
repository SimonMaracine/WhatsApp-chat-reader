# WhatsApp Chat Reader

This is a program which analyzes a WhatsApp chat (in two or group) and displays some information like the total number
of messages, or the number of messages that was sent from each participant and displays graphs like the number of messages
each day from the beginning, or the total number of messages on monday for example, or the total number of messages
at 10:00 PM for each day.

### How To Use

What you need to do is go to the chat you wish to examine, press on the **three dots in the top-right corner -> More
-> Export chat**. Then select **WITHOUT MEDIA** and send yourself an email with the chat file as the attachment.
Then go to your computer, download the file and open it in the program. That's it!

### Other

Do note that WhatsApp is a little limited and it only gives you the last 40,000 messages, if there are more than 40,000
in the chat.

If WhatsApp changes the format of the chat file it gives you, then this program will no longer work. It works as of
December 2020. It may no longer work in the future, if WhatsApp makes changes.

The program will not work correctly and will display incorrect information, if the name of the participants in the chat contain the ":" (colon) character.
It's simply an unsolvable problem.

For developers: The project was made with and was tested on Python 3.9. It works on Linux and Windows.
